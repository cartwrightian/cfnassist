Build Status
------------
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/cartwrightian/cfnassist.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/cartwrightian/cfnassist)

Key Features
------------
* Works with the existing syntax of cloud formation json, it just uses some simple conventions for parameters
* Implements a simple Project/Environment abstraction on top of AWS VPCs  (i.e. cfnassit/qa or cfnassit/dev)
* Manages application of create and update cloudformation scripts against particular Projects and Environments
* Tracks which scripts need to be applied to projects and environments using a simple delta tracking mechanism borrowed
from [dbdeploy](http://dbdeploy.com/)
* Autopopulates physical id's based on logical identifiers plus the project & environment,
this means you can break large scripts apart and think about project/env/logical ids instead of VPC id/physical id
* Assists with the [Phoenix Server](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PhoenixServer.html) pattern by automating the
switch over of instances for an ELB based on build numbers
* Allows upload to S3; along with the option of passing S3 urls of new aritifacts directly into cloudformation templates
* Use VPC Tags as input or output to templates using a simple convention in the parameter description
* Automatically pick up values from environmental variables and availability zones to use in template parameters
* Generates diagrams of VPCs by producing [graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) format files
* Manage ELB security groups by allowing you to add/remove your current IP to/from a specified environment
* Send notifcations via SNS for stack CREATE or DELETE actions

Usage
-----
The tool provides a command line interface and ant tasks. Examples of the CLI use below, see `exampleAntTasks.xml` for ant task usage. 

Warning
-------
Creating AWS resources can mean you might be liable for charges. Please check the AWS documentation.

Prerequisites
-------------
You need to be familiar with AWS, in particular VPCs and Cloud Formation.

Notes
-----
* The tool uses [DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/auth/DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain.html) to connect to AWS, please read to understand how to authenticate with cfnassist.
* The tool uses [DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html) to determine the region to operate in.
* For certain key parameters the tool checks for environmental variables, for example CFN\_ASSIST\_PROJECT and CFN\_ASSIST\_ENV, this is useful if you use tools like autoenv or are working on a particular project a lot.

Documentation TODOs
-------------------
* Mention rate limits and the caching approach?
* Add links to the various *example json files in the test/cfnScripts folder*

CLI HowTo
---------

The example CLIs below assume you have the environmental variable **CFN\_ASSIST\_PROJECT** set to your project, that `cfnassist` 
is on the PATH and the credentials and regions are available via the default AWS mechanisms, see notes above.

>export PATH=${PATH}:somepath/cfnassit-1.0.85/bin

1.Create a VPC and initialise with a Project and Environment
-------------------------------------------------------------

First create a VPC, for example:

`aws ec2 create-vpc --cidr-block 10.0.0.0/16`

result:

>VPC	10.0.0.0/16	dopt-5e4f5b3c	default	pending	vpc-926e8bf7  

Wait for the create to finish, use this to check the status

`aws ec2 describe-vpcs`

result:

>VPCS	10.0.0.0/16	dopt-5e4f5b3c	default	False	available	vpc-926e8bf7

Now use cfnassit to init the vpc with the tags it uses to id vpc's and track changes.

`cfnassist -env Dev -init vpc-926e8bf7`

Replace `vpc-926e8bf7` with the ID of your VPC.

Check this work as expected using 

`aws ec2 describe-vpcs`

You should see the VPC now has three tags associated with it:

>VPCS	10.0.0.0/16	dopt-5e4f5b3c	default	False	available	vpc-926e8bf7  
>TAGS	CFN\_ASSIST\_ENV	Dev  
>TAGS	CFN\_ASSIST\_DELTA	0   
>TAGS	CFN\_ASSIST\_PROJECT	tramchester  

Repeat above steps for other envs such as UAT and Prod

2.Set up your infrastructure 
----------------------------

This typically includes the things you don't need to change on every release. 
For example subnets, load balancers, NAT and internet gateways and so on. 
You may still want to clean out a VPC and rerun this on occasions to make sure you can fully recreate a fully working VPC from scratch. 
Live instances etc should probably be created during the CI build especially if you are doing blue/green deploys. More on this below.

After each script succeeds the VPC **CFN\_ASSIST\_DELTA** tag is updated, this way the tool only tries to create the required stacks for each VPC. The tool will also take care of deleting an existing stack if it is in the rollback complete state.

`cfnassist -env Dev -dir ./infrastructure`

My infrastructure dir looks like this:
>-rw-r--r--  1 icartwri  staff  1748 13 Jan 15:30 001subnets.json    
>-rw-r--r--  1 icartwri  staff   510 13 Jan 15:26 002internetGateway.json  
>-rw-r--r--  1 icartwri  staff  6287 13 Jan 21:34 003webSubnetAclAndSG.json  
>-rw-r--r--  1 icartwri  staff  1521 13 Jan 21:41 004dbSubnetAclAndSG.json  
>-rw-r--r--  1 icartwri  staff  5672 13 Jan 21:35 005intSubnetAclAndSG.json  
>-rw-r--r--  1 icartwri  staff  6572  9 Apr 15:46 006monSubnetAclAndSG.json  
>-rw-r--r--  1 icartwri  staff  5818 13 Jan 15:26 007natSubnetAclAndSG.json  
>-rw-r--r--  1 icartwri  staff  2842 13 Jan 21:46 008lbSubnetACLandSG.json  
>-rw-r--r--  1 icartwri  staff  1406 13 Jan 21:30 009natServer.json  
>-rw-r--r--  1 icartwri  staff   875 13 Jan 21:30 010elasticLoadBalancer.json  
>-rw-r--r--  1 icartwri  staff  3895 13 Jan 21:31 011routing.json  

The tool executes these in numeric order, hence the filenames beginning with numbers, it does 'create' by default but can also do 'updates', see below.

*Use Logical IDs*

The tool will inject the correct *Physical ID* for a resource based on the current VPC, it finds the correct VPC using the *Project* and *Environment* . You can declare a parameter exactly as normal for cloudformation but follow the convention below and cfn assit will find the correct *physical ID*:

>"Parameters" : {  
>                        "env" : { "Type" : "String" },  
>                        "vpc" : { "Type" : "String" },  
>                        "natSubnet" : { "Type" : "String" , "Description" : "::natSubnet" }  
>                },  

In this example **::natSubnet** triggers to cfn assist find the right Physical ID for that logical ID in the current VPC, 
it does this by scanning the stacks associated with the current VPC for that logical ID. 
Also note the tool automatically injects the correct VPC and env (i.e. dev, UAT, Prod, etc).

So the example above will apply all the cfn scripts found in the infrastructure dir in order, the cloud formation stacks created will include the project and env in their name as well as the filename. There are also tagged with the project and env (and build number if present, more on that below....)

*Results*

If all goes will the VPC tags get updated with the new delta index, so for example:

> TAGS	CFN\_ASSIST\_DELTA	11  
> TAGS	CFN\_ASSIST\_ENV	Dev  
> TAGS	CFN\_ASSIST\_PROJECT	tramchester  

You should also be able to see all the associated stacks using

`aws cloudformation describe-stacks`

*Create or Update?*

By default cfnassit invokes cloud formation 'create', but if the filename contains ends with `.update.json` (or `.delta.json`) it will do a cloud formation 'update'
instead. 
As described above cfnassit will keep track of which creates and updates been applied. The semantics of cloud formation updates are complex
and specific to the resource type involved, you need to **check the AWS documents** especially as some updates can actually result in a resource
being *recreated*.

3.Rolling changes back
----------------------

**Use with CARE!** 

This first command will rollback all delta's by deleting the stacks for a VPC in the correct order
and updating the DELTA tag on the VPC as it goes!
You may want to do this while getting things bedded in initially or when you want to check you can
fully recreate an environment.

`cfnassist -env Dev -purge`

~~cfnassist -env Dev -rollback ./infrastructure~~ is now deprecated, please use `-purge` which will work
if your stack was create after version 1.0.25.

Alternatively you can roll back just the last change using:

`cfnassist -env Dev -stepback`

~~cfnassist -env Dev -back ./infrastructure~~ is now deprecated, please use `-back` which will work
if your stack was create after version 1.0.25.


4.Built-in parameters and Mappings
----------------------------------

cnfassit auto-populates some parameters when it invokes the cloud formation api, 
you need to make sure these parameters are declared in your json otherwise the api will throw an error. 
The pre-populated variables are env and vpc, so you need to declare them:

> "Parameters":{  
>		"env":{  
>			"Type":"String"  
>		},  
>		"vpc":{  
>			"Type":"String"  
>		},  

You can then use cloudformation mappings in the usual way to inject environment specific parameters i.e.

>"Mappings" : {  
>                        "environMap" : {  
>                                "qa" : { "keyName" : "techLab", "NatEip" : "eipalloc-0fb76661" },  
>                                "test" : { "keyName" : "techLab", "NatEip" : "TBA" },  
>                                "prod" : { "keyName" : "techLab", "NatEip" : "eipalloc-1de56375" }  
>                        }  
>                },  

The automatically populated *env* parameter is a more portable way to do this than mappings based on the VPC ID, 
especially if you need to recreate an environment/vpc from scratch or move to a different AWS region.

Use the mappings exactly as normal in cloudformation:

> "KeyName": { "Fn::FindInMap" : [ "environMap", { "Ref" : "env" }, "keyName" ]} ,   

5.Create instances (without build numbers)
------------------------------------------

For some longer lived services/instances you can include them in your 'infrastructure' delta directory, 
but sometimes it is more flexible to create them seperately. 

For example RDS instances might be a resource you create but don't want to create/delete on each build.

`cfnassist -env Dev -file ./rdsInstance.json`

**NOTE: If you are now getting InsufficientCapabilitiesException or MissingCapabilities exceptions**

Amazon made a change to the API, for some types of resources you will get the above exceptions. 
To avoid this capabilities must be set on the create call. Use ` -capabilityIAM`  on the CLI or add `capabilityIAM="true"` to 
the cfnassist ant task. There is an example in distribution file `exampleAntTasks.xml`.

6.Create instances with build numbers
-------------------------------------

This is probably the more normal way to create instances, for example if you are using the Phoenix Server pattern.

`cfnassist -env Dev -file ./rdsInstance.json -build 876`

This will create a stack, with the stack and the instances tagged additionally with **CFN_ASSIST_BUILD_NUMBER**, 
the stack name will also include the build number.

7.List out the stacks
---------------------
*Work in progress: display format, not having to give the project, plus list out managed VPCs*

You can list out the stacks cfnassit is managing for a particular project/env using

`cfnassist -env Dev -ls` 

8.Pass parameters into the cloud formation scripts
--------------------------------------------------

You can declare the parameters exactly as you would for cloud formation. You can then pass values into them using the `parameters` argument.

`cfnassist -env Dev -file ./rdsInstance.json -build 876 -parameters "testA=123;testB=123"`

*Note: You'll need to escape the ; character as appropriate for your shell/cli*

9.Switch over ELB instances or Target Group using Build Number
--------------------------------------------------------------

This lets you switch over the instances an ELB is pointing at based on *build number* and a special tag **CFN_ASSIST_TYPE**. 
You can also update a target group in the same way if using the "V2" load balancers.

You need to set this *type tag* on the instances yourself, for example including the following in your instance definition:

>"Tags": [  
>                  { "Key" : "Name", "Value": "aTestInstance" },  
>                  { "Key" : "CFN_ASSIST_TYPE", "Value": "web" }  
>                ]  

Now you can switch over the ELB using

`cfnassist -env Dev -build 876 -elbUpdate web` 

Or for "V2" load balancers that use target group, not here you need to give the target port for the instance.

`cfnassist -env Dev -build 876 -targetGroupUpdate  web 8080`

This will find all the instances created in cloud formation stacks for the project/env *and* that have the 
appropriate **CFN_ASSIST_TYPE** tag. 

Next cfnassist finds the ELB for the VPC for the project and environment, addes the instances it found above to the ELB and 
*removes* any instances not matching the build number from the ELB or target group.

You can 'rollback' the ELB to point at the previous instances by giving their build number, so you may not want to immediately delete 
previous instances until sure all is ok with the new ones.

If more than one ELB, or target group, is found then cfnassist will check if the tag **CFN_ASSIST_TYPE** is present and matches the type tag you 
give above, if it is the tool will use that ELB, otherwise an error will be thrown. 

10.Reset the delta tag on a VPC
------------------------------

**Use with CARE!** 

This will reset the delta index tag on the corresponding VPC back to 0.

`cfnassist -env Dev -reset`

*If you have cloud formation stacks associated with the VPC you will not be able to manage them using cfnassit if you do this.*

11.Using SNS instead of polling for stack monitoring
----------------------------------------------------
By default cfnassist uses polling to check the status of stacks being created/updated/deleted. 
Cloud formation has the ability to publish SNS notifications as the status of a stack changes, 
and cfn assit can use these instead of polling to track status.

This avoids using polling meaning less network traffic and less chance of hitting 'rate limits' on the API

If you specify `-sns` on the commandline then cfnassit will 

1. Create a SNS topic using the name *CFN_ASSIST_EVENTS* (if it does not exist already)
2. Create a SQS queue using the name *CFN_ASSIST_EVENT_QUEUE* (again, only if required)
3. Create a policy meaning that SNS can publish the notifications to the queue. (and again, only if requied)
4. Finally it will subscribe the Queue to the SNS notifications.

If you try to delete a stack using the SNS option when the stack was not originally created with the 
flag set this will fail, however stack updates will work as expected.

12.Upload files or folders to S3 and inject corresponding URLs into templates
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can use cfnassist to upload files or folders into S3 and then pass in the S3 url's of those files into templates
automatically. The files will be prefixed with the build number i.e. /BUILDNUMBER/filename

The path to the file will be replaced with the URL, for example

`cfnassist -env Dev -file templateFile.json -artifacts "urlA=dist/release.txt;urlB=dist/deployable.tgz" -bucket bucketName MyBucket -build 1123`

This will upload the files `release.txt` and `deployable.tgz` to S3 bucket MyBucket and then populate the 
parameters `urlA` and `urlB` with the corresponding S3 urls and pass these into `templateFile.json`. 

You can also upload the contents of a folder, in this case the path to the folder will be replaced with the URL of the bucket and key.

**NOTE** 
The current file path is not used, so the file dist/release.txt will end up in the bucket MyBucket with the key 1123/release.txt, 
this applies to the individual files within a folder also.

You can use the environmental variable *CFN_ASSIST_BUCKET* to specify the S3 bucket to use.

13.Upload or delete arifacts in S3
----------------------------------
Sometimes you want to create or delete things in S3 independently of deploying templates.

`cfnassist -env Dev -s3create -artifacts "xzy=dist/release.txt;abc=dist/deployable.tgz" -bucket bucketName MyBucket -build 1123`

Or

`cfnassist -env Dev -s3create -artifacts "folder=dist/subFolder" -bucket bucketName MyBucket -build 1123`

The files will be uploaded as per 12 above.

To delete files you need to need to pass in the name of the files themselves.

`cfnassist -env Dev -s3delete -artifacts "mno=release.txt;rst=deployable.tgz -bucket bucketName MyBucket -build 1123`

**NOTE** 
The current file path is not used, so the file dist/release.txt will end up in the bucket MyBucket with the key `1123/release.txt`

14.Delete a stack
-----------------
You can delete stacks using the name, so for the above example.

`cfnassist -env Dev -build 1223 -rm templateFile`

Note that the name of stack in cloudformation will include the Project,
Environment and (optionally) the build number.

You can also delete a stack created with cfnassit using the following command:

`cfnassist -env Dev -build 1223 -delete ./templateFile.json`

This will delete the stack that was created from the templateFile.json file with the build number 1223.


15.Using VPC Tags
-----------------
cfnassist will automatically populate a Tag on the VPC based on a simple convention for the Output section of a cloudformation script.
For example having the following in your output section will cause a new tag called SUBNET to be created on the correct VPC for the current project/env combination. In this case the tag will contian the ID of a created subnet.

>"Outputs" : {
>	    "SUBNET" : {
>	        "Value" : { "Ref":"testSubnet" }, "Description":"::CFN_TAG"
>	    }

You can also use a VPC Tag value as in input parameter, just use the same convention for the input parameter as above.

>	"testVPCTAG":{
>			"Type":"String",
>			"Description":"::CFN_TAG"
>		}	

This example will try and find a TAG called testVPCTAG on the current VPC and inject it's value into the template.

16.Using Environemental Variables
---------------------------------
You can pick up a input parameter value from an environmental variable using the following convention in the description.

>"Parameters" : {  
>	"nameOfEnvVar":{ "Type":"String", "Description":"::ENV" }	
> }

This example will try and find a environmental variable called 'nameOfEnvVar' and inject it's value into the template using a 
parameter of the same name i.e. 'nameOfEnvVar'

17.Tidy up old stacks
---------------------
**USE WITH CARE - This deletes instances**

You can automatically delete stacks created from the same template (i.e. created with different build numbers) if those stacks
are no longer associated with an ELB.

`cfnassist -env Dev -tidyOldStacks ./templateFile.json typeTag`

Ihis will locate the ELB for the project/env using the tag **CFN_ASSIST_TYPE** to choose one if multiple are present, in this case
the tage would need to be set to `typeTag`.
Next all stacks created from the template `templateFile.json` are located and their instances scanned. 
If the stack has no instances associated with the ELB, or target group, then it will be deleted.

18.Generate VPC diagrams
------------------------

This will attempt to generate diagrams for your vpc, they are in the [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org/) format. 
Two diagrams will be generated for each VPC, one for the network configuration and one for the security.

**Work in progess - please give feedback via github issues**

`cfnassist -diagrams targetFolder`

> targetFolder/network_diagramvpc-56698c33.dot

> targetFolder/security_diagramvpc-56698c33.dot


19.Manage ELB Security Group access
-----------------------------------

This is helpful if you need to lock down access to a web site during development & testing while still allowing your 
current location to access it. 

`cfnassist -env Dev -allowCurrentIP web 80`

This will update the Security Group for the Dev environment's ELB to allow access to port 80 from your current 
public IP. To revoke the access use this command (from the same location/public IP!)

`cfnassist -env Dev -blockCurrentIP web 80`

If need be you can use the aws console or cli tool to upadte the ELB secuity group, for example if you forget to revoke access 
before leaving a location.

If more than one ELB is found then cfnassist will check if the tag **CFN_ASSIST_TYPE** is present and matches the type tag you 
give above, if it is the tool will use that ELB, otherwise an error will be thrown. 

`cfnassist -env Dev -allowhost web hostname 80`

This will update the Security Group for the Dev environment's ELB to allow access to port 80 from 
any of the hosts IPs. To revoke the access use this command

`cfnassist -env Dev -blockhost web hostname 80`

20.Stack Notifications
----------------------

This can be very useful for notifying people or other software of updates to cloud formation.

Cfnassist with detect if there is a SNS topic called 'CFN_ASSIST_NOTIFICATIONS' available and accessible for the user.
If so notifications are sent containing the stackname, status, user id and user name.
Make sure the user has permissions to do the 'getuser' call on the AWS api. You can wire up SNS to email etc via AWS.

21.Auto populate availability zones
-----------------------------------

This allows auto population of the correct AZ names for the current region.

>"Parameters" : {
>	"zoneA":{ "Type":"String", "Description":"::CFN_ZONE_A" },
>   "zoneB":{ "Type":"String", "Description":"::CFN_ZONE_B" }
> }

This means you can more easily create portable templates that
will work in different regions without change.
In the above example zoneA and zoneB will be populated with the
correct zone names for the current region.

22.Create a key pair
--------------------

`cfnassist -env Dev -keypair <filename>`

This will create a key pair named after the current project and
environment. A tag will be created on the VPC for the project/env
that contains the keyname, the TAG is called 'keypairname'.

**NOTE**
NEVER save a private key in a place where it could get checked into your source control,

The key will be named '<projectName>_<env name>_keypair'.
If you provide a `filename` the private key will be saved in this file. If you don't
give a filename the key will be saved in `$HOME/.ssh/<projectName>_<env name>.pem`

**NOTE**
ALWAYS Keep your private keys safe

23.Manage cloudwatch logs
-------------------------

`cfnassist -env Dev -logs 6`

Down and save in files (named after cloudwatch log groups) the log events form the last N hours. 
The log groups need to be tagged with the appropriate CFN_ASSIST_ENV and CNF_ASSIST_PROJECT tags, see below.

`cfnassist -env Dev -removeLogs 1`

Delete cloudwatch log events/streams older than N Days.

**NOTE**
Use with care, this is permanently delete the events

`cfnassist -env UAT -tagLog logGroupName`

Tags the given log group with CFN_ASSIST_ENV and CNF_ASSIST_PROJECT using the given values.
